= bndly common data api

This bundle contains Classes to deal with data.

The central interface is Data.class which holds the data and conatins information about content type, creation and name of the data object.
Data can be accessed via a ReplayableInputStream.

Data objects can be created by putting files into a watched Folder.
The bundle also contains the api for a configurable Folderwatcher (~Factory for multiple Folders).
Consuming services can register a FolderWatcherListener to get informed when a new Data object is available.

Implementation for a standard file system are located in bndly common data file-system-data-impl.
